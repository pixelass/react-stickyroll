# Your kickstart into Stickyroll

> ⏱ **Time invest**: 10 Minutes ––– 👨‍🎓 **Level**: Beginner

## What to expect

Building scroll aware fullscreen views can be a complex process but Stickyroll is made for this
exact purpose.
In about 10 minutes we will have a simple app that allows endless possibilities.

We will …

-   … set up a react app with `create-react-app`
-   … install Stickyroll from npm
-   … build a simple scroll-view

## You'll need

-   Terminal (MacOS: `Terminal.app` or [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) | Windows: [cmder](http://cmder.net/))
-   🐢 Node.js `>=10` ([Install](https://nodejs.org/en/))

## Installing node.js

This project requires node.js, so please make sure it is installed on your
machine. You can find the [downloads here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

This guide expects Node.js >=10.

## Creating a React App

To get started with Stickyroll you need a simple react project.
In this guide we will use create-react-app to make this step easier.

_The next section is quoted from the github readme of create-react-app. (Wed Dec 05 2018 23:51:26 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time))_

> 💁‍
> To create a new app, run a single command:
>
> ```sh
> npx create-react-app my-app
> ```
>
> \*(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher.)
>
> It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.
> [...]
> Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:
>
> ```sh
> cd my-app
> ```

## Your first Stickyroll

Follow these 3 simple steps to build your first Stickyroll.

### 1. Installing Stickyroll

While in your app folder `my-app`, run a single command:

```shell
npm install --save @stickyroll/stickyroll
```

### 2. Creating a Stickyroll

Open the file `my-app/src/App.css` in your text editor and replace
the entire content with this code.

```css
body {
	margin: 0;
}
* {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Open the file `my-app/src/App.js` in your text editor and replace
the entire content with this code.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {Stickyroll} from "@stickyroll/stickyroll";

const pages = [
	{
		title: "Hello World!"
	},
	{
		title: "Hello React!"
	},
	{
		title: "Hello Stickyroll!"
	}
];

const App = () => {
	return (
		<Stickyroll pages={pages}>
			{({currentPage, pageIndex, pageCount, progress}) => {
				return (
					<div>
						Page <strong>{currentPage}</strong> of <strong>{pageCount}</strong>
						<br />
						Progress: <strong>{progress}</strong>
						<br />
						<h1>{pages[pageIndex].title}</h1>
					</div>
				);
			}}
		</Stickyroll>
	);
};

export default App;
```

### 3. Starting the app

To start the app run a single command:

```
npm start
```

The browser should open the app. If for some reason your browser des not automatically show the app,
simply navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and you're good to go.

`@stickyroll/stickyroll` provides the main component and a `{Listener}` to build context aware plugins.
But that is a topic for later.

#### Explore your Stickyroll

Stickyroll stays in the visible area of the viewport while you scroll the page.

-   Try using the "arrow down key" on your keyboard to navigate the page.
-   The "arrow up key" allows you to scroll back, reverting the progress.
-   You can use the scrollbar, a mouse, trackpad or any other device to navigate the page.
-   Open the app on your mobile device and test it's behavior.

You can now add more logic to your Stickyroll.

Enjoy!

## Advanced usage

Stickyroll allows a lot more than just writing numbers on the screen. If you are
familiar with React.js or comfortable with your demo app and want
to add custom behaviour you can take a look at the next steps in this guide.
